# TODO

## Tests

* Jest

## ES6-ify

* convert protos to classes
* consider replacing for loops

### Modules

#### R

Object.keys(R)
(13)Â ["maxi", "samplei", "randi", "softmax", "assert", "Mat", "RandMat", "forwardLSTM", "initLSTM", "forwardRNN", "initRNN", "Solver", "Graph"]

#### Rvis

Just has "Graph"
Just used to do visualization
Redo this...use React for everything

## Restructure

* functions instead of classes
* generators

## Website

* Hardcode values at first, just get it working, confirm shit's still working
  * output stuff in UI for visual feedback
    * epoch
    * complexity
    * model samples
* pull in antd
* CSS reset
* Split demo and lib into different folders...or repos? (lib shouldn't have any dependency on next)
* Make lib an npm package?
* deploy to somewhere
