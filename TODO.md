# TODO

## ES6-ify

* check all for loops

## Restructure

* (in progress) Method for updating weights on Mat. Can either take new weights array or a map function.

* better data structure...hyper params, input etc need a home
* functions instead of classes
  * generators
* Use victory or something instead of vis and delete vis

## Tests

* Jest

## Website

* get antd working (CSS problem?) or some other UI component lib
  * output stuff to UI
* Redesign
  * Responsive
  * Showcase the experiment more...visible on load
  * Grab any images used in original (deleted the external/ dir just to clean things up for now)
  * Put in text of original

## Publish

* Split demo and lib into different folders...or repos? (recurrent should be agnostic of UI and any other lib)
* Make lib an npm package?
* Deploy to somewhere
* Write blog
