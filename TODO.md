# TODO

## Website

* Label chart axes...maybe make it look a bit nicer?
* Click to get one new sample at a time while paused
* Just show the experiment and nothing else, maybe link to info about RNNs in a footnote kind of way
* Better names for ppl list / data...final pass through for code quality

### More RNN Features

* Change hidden sizes
* Change between RNN and LSTM
* All other args that can be passed to create
* All other args that can be passed to train

## Publish

* Deploy to somewhere
* Write blog
