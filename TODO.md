# TODO

## Tests

* Jest

## ES6-ify

* check over all for loops...replace all possible
* convert protos to classes

### Modules

#### R

Object.keys(R)
(13)Â ["maxi", "samplei", "randi", "softmax", "assert", "Mat", "RandMat", "forwardLSTM", "initLSTM", "forwardRNN", "initRNN", "Solver", "Graph"]

#### Rvis

Just has "Graph"
Just used to do visualization
Redo this...use React for everything

## Restructure

* functions instead of classes
* generators
* better data structure...hyper params, input etc needs a home

## Website

* output stuff to UI
* get antd working (CSS problem?)
* CSS reset
* Grab any images used in original (deleted the external/ dir just to clean things up for now)

## Publish

* Split demo and lib into different folders...or repos? (recurrent should be agnostic of UI and any other lib)
* Make lib an npm package?
* Deploy to somewhere
* Write blog
